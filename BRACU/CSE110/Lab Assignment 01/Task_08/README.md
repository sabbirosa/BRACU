Write the Python code of a program that reads an integer, and `prints the integer` if it is a multiple of 2 AND 5 and prints `Not multiple of 2 and 5 both` otherwise.

For example, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 â€¦ i.e. this only includes numbers which are multiples of both 2 and 5.

`Hint(1):` We may use the `modulus (%)` operator for checking the divisibility.

`Hint(2):` We can consider the number to be an integer.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |        Sample Output         |
| :----------: | :--------------------------: |
|      30      |              30              |
|      15      | Not multiple of 2 and 5 both |
|      6       | Not multiple of 2 and 5 both |
