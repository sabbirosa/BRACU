Write the Python code of a program that reads two numbers from the user, and prints their `sum`, `product`, and `difference`.

`Hint:` subtract the second number from the first one

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output                                   |
| :----------: | ----------------------------------------------- |
|   4 <br> 5   | Sum = 9 <br> Product = 20 <br> Difference = -1  |
|  30 <br> 2   | Sum = 32 <br> Product = 60 <br> Difference = 28 |
