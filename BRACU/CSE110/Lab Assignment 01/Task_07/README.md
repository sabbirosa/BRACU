Write the Python code of a program that reads an integer, and `prints the integer` it is a multiple of either 2 or 5 but not both. If the number is a multiple of 2 and 5 both, then print `Multiple of 2 and 5 both`. For all other numbers, the program prints `Not a multiple we want`.

For example, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22 â€¦ i.e. this includes multiples of 2 only and multiples of 5 only, NOT multiples of 2 and 5 both or other numbers.

`Hint(1):` We may use the `modulus (%)` operator for checking the divisibility.

`Hint(2):` We can consider the number to be an integer.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |      Sample Output       |
| :----------: | :----------------------: |
|      6       |            6             |
|      15      |            15            |
|      10      | Multiple of 2 and 5 both |
|      17      |  Not a multiple we want  |
