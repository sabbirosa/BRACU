Write the Python code of a program that reads two numbers, subtracts the smaller number from the larger one, and `prints the result`.

`Hint:` First, we may check which number is greater.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
| -40 <br> -4  |      36       |
|   6 <br> 2   |       4       |
|   5 <br> 5   |       0       |

`Explanation:` -4 > -40 so -4 - (-40) = -4 + 40 = 36
