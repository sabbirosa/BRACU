Write the Python code of a program that reads an integer, and prints the integer if it is a `multiple of NEITHER 2 NOR 5`.
<br>
For example, 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37, 39 â€¦

`Hint(1):` We may use the `modulus (%)` operator for checking the divisibility.

`Hint(2):` We can consider the number to be an integer.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|      3       |       3       |
|      19      |      19       |
|      5       |      No       |
|      12      |      No       |
