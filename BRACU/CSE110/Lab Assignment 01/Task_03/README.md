Write the Python code of a program that reads two numbers from the user. The program should then print `First is greater` if the first number is greater, `Second is greater` if the second number is greater, and `The numbers are equal` otherwise.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output         |
| :----------: | --------------------- |
|   7 <br> 3   | First is greater      |
|  -33 <br> 3  | Second is greater     |
|  11 <br> 11  | The numbers are equal |
