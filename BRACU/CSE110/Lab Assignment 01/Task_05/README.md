Write the Python code of a program that reads a number, and prints `The number is even` or `The number is odd`, depending on whether the number is even or odd.

`Hint(1):` We may use the `modulus (%)` operator to check for even or odd.

`Hint(2):` We can consider the number to be an integer.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |   Sample Output    |
| :----------: | :----------------: |
|      7       | The number is odd  |
|      10      | The number is even |
|     -44      | The number is even |
