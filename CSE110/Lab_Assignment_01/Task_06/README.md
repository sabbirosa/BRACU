Write the Python code of a program that reads an integer as input from the user, and `prints the integer` if it is a multiple of 2 OR 5 and prints `Not a multiple of 2 OR 5` otherwise.

For example, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22 â€¦ i.e. This includes multiples of 2 only, multiples of 5 only and multiples of 2 and 5 both.

`Hint(1):` We may use the `modulus (%)` operator for checking the divisibility.

`Hint(2):` We can consider the number to be an integer.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |      Sample Output       |
| :----------: | :----------------------: |
|      5       |            5             |
|      10      |            10            |
|     -44      | Not a multiple of 2 OR 5 |
