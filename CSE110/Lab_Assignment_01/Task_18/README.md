Write the Python code of a program that reads an integer, and prints the integer if it is `NOT a multiple of 2` OR `NOT a multiple of 5`.
<br>
For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22

`Hint(1):` We may use the `modulus (%)` operator for checking the divisibility.

`Hint(2):` We can consider the number to be an integer.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|      3       |       3       |
|      15      |      15       |
|      20      |      No       |
|      14      |      14       |
