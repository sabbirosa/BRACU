Fiona has recently started acrylic painting and she is planning to order a few canvases and paints from an online stationery shop. The price of each 10 x 10 sized canvas is 120 tk and the price of each 25 ml paint tube is 75 tk. Depending on the total amount ordered from the shop, she will get some discounts. The table below shows the discount she will get on her total amount.

| Total Amount (TK) | Discount (TK) |
| ----------------- | :-----------: |
| 0 - 299           |  No Discount  |
| 300 - 499         |      10       |
| 500 - 749         |      20       |
| 750 - 999         |      50       |
| >= 1000           |      150      |

Write a python program and take two inputs from the user. The first input will be the number of canvases and the second input will be the number of paint tubes ordered. Based on the price of each item, calculate the `total amount` that Fiona needs to pay including the discount.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |                      Sample Output                       |
| :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
|   5 <br> 8   | Previous total: 1200 <br> New total after discount: 1050 |
|   0 <br> 3   |  Previous total: 225 <br> New total after discount: 225  |

`Explanation:` 5 \* 120 + 8 \* 75 = 1200 Tk was her bill without discount. For 1200 Tk, the discount amount is 150 Tk. So, her new bill with a discount is (1200 - 150) = 1050 Tk.
