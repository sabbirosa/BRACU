Write a python program that takes a string as an input from the user and then modifies the string in such a way that the string always starts with an uppercase letter and the case of each subsequent letter is the opposite of the previous letter (uppercase character followed by a lowercase character followed by an uppercase character and so on). Finally the modified string is printed to show the user.

`Hint:` Flags/counters can be used to manage uppercase-lowercase.

#### Test Case:

|          Sample Input           |          Sample Output          |
