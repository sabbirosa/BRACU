Write a python program that takes two inputs. The first input is a string and the second input is a number. If the number is even then concatenate the given string two times the given number and if the number is odd then concatenate the given string three times the given number.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  CSE110
  4
```

Sample Output:

```
  CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110
```

`Explanation:` The second input which is the number 4 is even, therefore the first string input 'CSE110' is concatenated(joined together) 4\*2 = 8 times.

Sample Input:

```
  CSE110
  3
```

Sample Output:

```
  CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110
```
