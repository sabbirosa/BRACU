Write a Python program that takes a String as input from the user, removes the characters at even index and prints the resulting String in uppercase without using the built-in function upper().

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|    String    |      TIG      |
|     abcd     |      BD       |

`Explanation:` The characters in first input 'S', 'r' and 'n' are at index positions 0, 2, and 4 respectively. Hence they are removed and the remaining characters 'tig' are capitalized giving us output 'TIG'.
