Write a python program that splits a given string on a given split character. The first input is a String and the second input is the character that will be used to split the first String.

**[You cannot use the built-in split function for this task]**

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  This-is-CSE110
  -
```

Sample Output:

```
  This
  is
  CSE110
```

`Explanation:` The second input which is the character '-', is used to split or divide the first input String 'This-is-CSE110' into 'This', 'is' and 'CSE110' which are printed individually in separate lines.

Sample Input:

```
  tom@gmail,harry@yahoo,bob@gmail,mary@gmail
  ,
```

Sample Output:

```
  tom@gmail
  harry@yahoo
  bob@gmail
  mary@gmail
```
