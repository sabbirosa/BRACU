Write a Python program that takes a string as an input from the user containing all small letters and then prints the next alphabet in sequence for each alphabet in the input.

`Hint:` You may need to use the functions ord() and chr(). The ASCII value of ‘a’ is 97 and ‘z’ is 122.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|     abcd     |     bcde      |
|   the cow    |    uif!dpx    |
|    xyzabc    |    yzabcd     |
