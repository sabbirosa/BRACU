Write a Python program that will ask the user to input a string (containing exactly one word). Then print the ASCII code for each character in the String using the ord() function.

To check if your program is working correctly or not, you can find a list of all correct values from the following website. You may look at “Dec” and “Char” columns only and ignore the other columns for this problem.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  Programming
```

Sample Output:

```
  P : 80
  r : 114
  o : 111
  g : 103
  r : 114
  a : 97
  m : 109
  m : 109
  i : 105
  n : 110
  g : 103
```

`Explanation:` Each line prints a letter sequentially from the given string and its corresponding ASCII value separated by " : ".

Sample Input:

```
  hunger
```

Sample Output:

```
  h : 104
  u : 117
  n : 110
  g : 103
  e : 101
  r : 114
```
