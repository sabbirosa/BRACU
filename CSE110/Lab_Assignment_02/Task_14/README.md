Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and prints the `divisors` of that number as well as `how many divisors` the number has.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |           Sample Output           |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------: |
|      6       | 1, 2, 3, 6 <br> Total 4 divisors. |
|     121      | 1, 11, 121 <br> Total 3 divisors. |
