Write a python program that prints a square of size N using + where N will be given as input as illustrated in the examples below.

`Hint:` You may need to use nested loops to solve this problem.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  5
```

Sample Output:

```
  +++++
  +++++
  +++++
  +++++
  +++++
```

`Explanation:` Here, we may see it as 5 rows and 5 columns, where in each horizontal row/line, 5 '+' is printed next to each other and we have a total of 5 lines.

Sample Input:

```
  3
```

Sample Output:

```
  +++
  +++
  +++

```

`Explanation:` If the input is 3, then there will be 3 rows and 3 columns, where in each horizontal row/line, '+' is printed 3 times, 1 in each of the 3 columns and we will have a total of 3 lines.
