Write a Python program that takes a number and prints how many digits are in that number.

**[Consider the input number to be an INTEGER.]**

**[You are not allowed to use len() function]**

Example: If the user gives 9876, your program should print 4.

Hint: We may keep floor dividing by ten and count how many times this can be done until the number becomes 0 as illustrated below.

```
9876 // 10 = 987, count = 1
then, 987 // 10 = 98, count = 2
98 // 10 = 9, count = 3
9 // 10 = 0, count = 4
```

Done! When the number becomes 0 your loop can end giving you the count of digits, in this case for our input of 9876, 4 digits.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|      78      |       2       |
|    132929    |       6       |
