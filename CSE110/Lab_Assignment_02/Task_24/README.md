Write a Python program that asks the user for a range (a starting number and an ending number) and then counts how many numbers are prime numbers and how many numbers are perfect numbers between that range. It also prints those numbers in the format shown in the output of the example given below.

`Hint(1):` We may declare two strings/lists to store the prime and perfect numbers. Inside the loop, we check for prime and perfect numbers and add them to respective string/list besides counting them.

`Hint(2):` We may need to convert numbers in String to integers for checking and calculations. We may again need to convert numbers to Strings for storing and printing as the outputs shown in the example below.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  2
  6
```

Sample Output:

```
  Between 2 and 6,
  Found 3 prime numbers
  Found 1 perfect number
  Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5
  Perfect number: 6
```

`Explanation:` The user have given a range of between 2 and 6, and there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) and 1 perfect number (6) in that range.
