Write a python program that prints a rectangle of size M (height/line numbers) and N (length/column numbers) using incrementing numbers where M and N will be given as input. Please look at the examples below for clarification.

`Hint:` You may need to use nested loops and print the loop counter variable in one of the loops.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  4
  6
```

Sample Output:

```
  123456
  123456
  123456
  123456
  123456
```

`Explanation:` The user has given 4 rows/lines and 6 columns as input. Therefore, we have 4 lines in our output here and in each line, the column number is printed from 1 through to 6 for the 6 columns.

Sample Input:

```
  3
  2
```

Sample Output:

```
  12
  12
```

`Explanation:` The user input this time is 3 rows/lines and 2 columns. So, our output has 3 lines and in each line, the column number 1 and 2 are printed next to each other as the user only wants 2 columns here.
