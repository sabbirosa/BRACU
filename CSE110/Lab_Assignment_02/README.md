# Lab Assignment 2 (Loops) üìù

### Task 1

Write the python programs, which prints the following sequences of values in loops:

a) 24, 18, 12, 6, 0, -6

b) -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20

c) 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63

d) 18, -27, 36, -45, 54, -63

`Hint(1):` We may use a while loop for solving these problems.

`Hint(2):` We are already familiar with the print() function. But, when we use it to print any value, it automatically adds an additional newline after each print statement.

For example:

```
  print(1)
  print(2)
```

Output:

```
  1
  2
```

`Hint(3):` To solve this problem, in Python3, we can add an extra argument (end = " ") in the print function which tells the program to skip printing the additional newline.

For example:

```
  print(1, end ="")
  print(2)
```

Output: (prints the next output right to the previous one)

```
  12
```

`Hints for 1(d):` To print negative integer we may use `string concatenation` or `multiply the integer with -1`.

For example:

```
  print(5 * (-1))
  print("-" + str(5))
```

Output:

```
  print(5 * (-1))
  print("-" + str(5))
```

`Explaination:` In Task-1(a), the loop counter may be initialized at 24 and then the loop should terminate when the loop counter reaches -6. The difference between the first two values is 24 - 18 = 6. So the loop counter value is getting decremented by 6 in every iteration for the given sequence here.

```

Sample Output:

```
  1
  3
  6
  10
  15
```

`Explanation:` When the user enters 1 at first, we print 1, then The user enters 2, (1 + 2) = 3, so our output is 3, then The user enters 3, (3 + 3) = 6, hence our output is 6, then The user enters 4, and we have (6 + 4) = 10, we print 10, and finally The user enters 5, the final sum is 15 which is printed as the last output.

Sample Input:

### Task 11

Write a Python program which takes a number and prints the digits from the unit place, then the tenth, then hundredth, etc. **(Right to Left)**

**[Consider the input number to be an INTEGER. You are not allowed to use String indexing for solving this task]**

Example: If the user gives 32768, then print 8, 6, 7, 2, 3

`Hint(1):` The input() function, converts the input data to String data type by default. Therefore, please type cast it to an integer before proceeding further.

`Hint(2):` First to get the digit from the right side, we can take the remainder of the number using modulus (%) operator i.e. mod 10 to get the rightmost digit and print it. For dropping the last digit, we can perform floor division by 10 on the number and then continue the same to print the other digits as shown below.

```
32768 % 10 = 8

32768 // 10 = 3276

Then,

3276 % 10 = 6

3276 // 10 = 327

and so on

327 % 10 = 7

327 // 10 = 32

32 % 10 = 2

32 // 10 = 3

3 % 10 = 3

3 // 10 = 0
```

Done! When the number becomes 0 you can end your loop.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |  Sample Output   |
| :----------: | :--------------: |
|    32768     |  8, 6, 7, 2, 3   |
|    132929    | 9, 2, 9, 2, 3, 1 |

### Task 12

Write a Python program that takes a number and prints how many digits are in that number.

**[Consider the input number to be an INTEGER.]**

**[You are not allowed to use len() function]**

Example: If the user gives 9876, your program should print 4.

Hint: We may keep floor dividing by ten and count how many times this can be done until the number becomes 0 as illustrated below.

```
9876 // 10 = 987, count = 1
then, 987 // 10 = 98, count = 2
98 // 10 = 9, count = 3
9 // 10 = 0, count = 4
```

Done! When the number becomes 0 your loop can end giving you the count of digits, in this case for our input of 9876, 4 digits.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|      78      |       2       |
|    132929    |       6       |

### Task 13

Write a Python program that takes a number from the user and prints its digits **from left to right**.

**[Consider the input number to be an INTEGER. You are not allowed to use String indexing for solving this task]**

Example: if the user gives 32768, then print 3, 2, 7, 6, 8

`Hint(1):` The input() function takes the input data as String data type by default. Please convert it to an integer before starting your code for the task.

`Hint(2):` First, count how many digits. Then, calculate 10 to the power (number of digits - 1). Say, the input given by the user as in our example, 32768 has 5 digits, so calculating 10 to the power 4 gives us 10000. Then floor dividing 32768 by 10000, we can get 3. Proceeding further, the remainder of 32768 by 10000 (32768 % 10000) gives us 2768. This time to get 2 we need to floor divide 2768 by 1000 which is basically our 10000/10. Again, taking remainder of 2768 by 1000 gives us 768 which we then divide by 100 (i.e. 1000/10) and keep on doing this until there are no more digits left (zero).

**To summarize and clarify:**

- Loop 1: First, we count digits like our Task 12, say 5 in this case for 32768
- Loop 2: Then, we calculate 10 to the power 4 (5-1), that is 10000.
- Loop 3: Then we keep repeating the three steps of floor dividing, modulus and dividing by 10 as demonstrated below.

```
32768 // 10000 = 3
32768 % 10000 = 2768
10000 // 10 = 1000

2768 // 1000 = 2
2768 % 1000 = 768
1000 // 10 = 100

768 // 100 = 7
768 % 100 = 68
100 // 10 = 10

68 // 10 = 6
68 % 10 = 8
10 // 10 = 1

8 // 1 = 8
8 % 1 = 0
1 // 10 = 0
```

Done. Loop ends as number has become 0.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |  Sample Output   |
| :----------: | :--------------: |
|    32768     |  3, 2, 7, 6, 8   |
|    132929    | 1, 3, 2, 9, 2, 9 |

### Task 14

Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and prints the `divisors` of that number as well as `how many divisors` the number has.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |           Sample Output           |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------: |
|      6       | 1, 2, 3, 6 <br> Total 4 divisors. |
|     121      | 1, 11, 121 <br> Total 3 divisors. |

Solution: ‚ö° [Task 14](https://github.com/sabbirosa/BRACU/tree/main/CSE110/Lab_Assignment_02/Task_14/Task14.py)

---

### Task 15

Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and tells if it is a perfect number or not.

`Perfect Number:` An integer number is said to be a perfect number if its factors, including 1 but not the number itself, sum to the number.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |       Sample Output        |
| :----------: | :------------------------: |
|      6       |   6 is a perfect number    |
|      28      |   28 is a perfect number   |
|      33      | 33 is not a perfect number |

`Explanation:` In first test case 6 has 4 divisors: 1, 2, 3, and 6. If we add all factors except 6 itself, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. The sum of the factors excluding the number itself sum up to the number therefore "6 is a perfect number" is printed. And in third test case 33 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 11, and 33. If we add all factors except itself, 15 = 1 + 3 + 11. The sum is not equal to the number, therefore 33 is not a perfect number.

Solution: ‚ö° [Task 15](https://github.com/sabbirosa/BRACU/tree/main/CSE110/Lab_Assignment_02/Task_15/Task15.py)

---

### Task 16

Write a Python program that asks the user for one number and tells if it is a prime number or not.

`Prime Number:` If a number has only two divisors, (1 and itself), then it is a prime number. If it is divisible by more numbers, then it is not a prime.

`Hint:` We may use the code for counting divisors from Task 14.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |      Sample Output      |
| :----------: | :---------------------: |
|      6       | 6 is not a prime number |
|      11      |  11 is a prime number   |

`Explanation:` 6 has 4 divisors: 1, 2, 3 and 6. And 11 has only 2 divisors: 1 and 11.

Solution: ‚ö° [Task 16](https://github.com/sabbirosa/BRACU/tree/main/CSE110/Lab_Assignment_02/Task_16/Task16.py)

### Task 17

Write a Python program that asks the user for a quantity, then takes that many numbers as input and prints the maximum, minimum and average of those numbers.

**[Please note that you CANNOT use max, min built-in functions]**

**[Also, you DO NOT need to use lists for this task]**

`Example:` If the user enters 5 as an input for quantity and the enters the 5 numbers, 10, 4, -1, -100, and 1.
The output of your program should be: ‚ÄúMaximum 10‚Äù, ‚ÄúMinimum -100‚Äù, ‚ÄúAverage is -17.2‚Äù as shown below.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

`Explanation:` Here, we may see it as 5 rows and 5 columns, where in each horizontal row/line, 5 '+' is printed next to each other and we have a total of 5 lines.

Sample Input:

```
  3
```

Sample Output:

```
  +++
  +++
  +++

```

`Explanation:` If the input is 3, then there will be 3 rows and 3 columns, where in each horizontal row/line, '+' is printed 3 times, 1 in each of the 3 columns and we will have a total of 3 lines.

Sample Input:

```
  3
  2
```

Sample Output:

```
  12
  12
```

`Explanation:` The user input this time is 3 rows/lines and 2 columns. So, our output has 3 lines and in each line, the column number 1 and 2 are printed next to each other as the user only wants 2 columns here.

`Fibonacci number:` A Fibonacci number is a number which is the summation of its previous two fibonacci numbers.

The first two fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1.

So, the 3rd is 0 + 1 = 1,

the 4th is 1 + 1 = 2,

the 5th is 1 + 2 = 3,

the 6th one is 2 + 3 = 5,

and so on.

### Task 22

Write a python program that converts a decimal integer number to a binary number.

`Hint:` A decimal can be converted to a binary number by keeping track of the remainders after each division of that number by 2.

For example, to convert 11 to a binary number, we can try the following approach.

```
11 // 2 = 5 (Remainder 1)
5 // 2 = 2 (Remainder 1)
2 // 2 = 1 (Remainder 0)
1 // 2 = 0 (Remainder 1)
```

Now, taking the remainders from bottom to top gives us the binary number which is 1011. Binary of 11 is 1011.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|      11      |     1011      |

---

### Task 23

Write a python program that converts a binary number to a decimal integer number after taking the binary number as an input from the user.

`Note:` A binary number can be converted to its corresponding decimal number by multiplying each binary digit with a power of 2, where the power denotes the position of the binary digit

For example, to convert 1010 to decimal, we can do this

$2^3$ x $1 + 2^2$ x $0 + 2^1$ x $1 + 2^0$ x $0 = 10$

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |

### Task 24

Write a Python program that asks the user for a range (a starting number and an ending number) and then counts how many numbers are prime numbers and how many numbers are perfect numbers between that range. It also prints those numbers in the format shown in the output of the example given below.

`Hint(1):` We may declare two strings/lists to store the prime and perfect numbers. Inside the loop, we check for prime and perfect numbers and add them to respective string/list besides counting them.

`Hint(2):` We may need to convert numbers in String to integers for checking and calculations. We may again need to convert numbers to Strings for storing and printing as the outputs shown in the example below.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  2
  6
```

### Task 25

Write a python program that asks the user for a range, a starting number(inclusive) and an ending number (inclusive). Then, take another input to for checking. If the product of all the digits of each number in the range is divisible by the third input, then print the number.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  24
  30
  4
```

Sample Output:

```
  12 16 0
```

`Explanation:` The product of all the digits of each number from 25 to 30 are 2 x 5, 2 x 6, 2 x 7, 2 x 8, 2 x 9 and 3 x 0. The final products are 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 0 respectively. Out of these numbers only 12, 16 and 0 are divisible by the third input 4 and therefore they are printed.

Sample Input:

```
  351
  356
  9
```

Sample Output:

```
  45 90
```

`Explanation:` The product of all the digits of each number from 351 to 356 are 3x5x1, 3x5x2, 3x5x3, 3x5x4, 3x5x5 and 3x5x6. The final products are 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 respectively. Out of these numbers only 45 and 90 are divisible by 9 and therefore they are printed.
