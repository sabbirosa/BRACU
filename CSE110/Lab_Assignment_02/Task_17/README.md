Write a Python program that asks the user for a quantity, then takes that many numbers as input and prints the maximum, minimum and average of those numbers.

**[Please note that you CANNOT use max, min built-in functions]**

**[Also, you DO NOT need to use lists for this task]**

`Example:` If the user enters 5 as an input for quantity and the enters the 5 numbers, 10, 4, -1, -100, and 1.
The output of your program should be: “Maximum 10”, “Minimum -100”, “Average is -17.2” as shown below.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  5
  10
  4
  -1
  -100
  1
```

Sample Output:

```
  Maximum 10
  Minimum -100
  Average is -17.2
```

`Explanation:` Average calculation: (10 + 4 + (-1) + (-100) + 1)/5 = -86/5 = -17.2
