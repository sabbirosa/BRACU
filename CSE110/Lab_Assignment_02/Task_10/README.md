Write a Python code that will read 5 numbers from the user. Your program should print the first number, the sum of the first 2 numbers, the sum of the first 3 numbers, and so on up to the sum of 5 numbers.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
```

Sample Output:

```
  1
  3
  6
  10
  15
```

`Explanation:` When the user enters 1 at first, we print 1, then The user enters 2, (1 + 2) = 3, so our output is 3, then The user enters 3, (3 + 3) = 6, hence our output is 6, then The user enters 4, and we have (6 + 4) = 10, we print 10, and finally The user enters 5, the final sum is 15 which is printed as the last output.

Sample Input:

```
  11
  -29
  -3
  47
  50
```

Sample Output:

```
  11
  -18
  -21
  26
  76
```

`Explanation:`
When the user enters 11 at first, we print 11, then The user enters -29, (11 + (-29)) = -18, so our output is -18, then The user enters -3, (-18 - 3) = -21, hence our output is -21, then The user enters 4, and we have (-21 + 47) = 26, we print 26, and finally The user enters 50, the final sum is (26 + 50) = 76 which is printed as the last output.
