Write a Python program that asks the user for one number and tells if it is a prime number or not.

`Prime Number:` If a number has only two divisors, (1 and itself), then it is a prime number. If it is divisible by more numbers, then it is not a prime.

`Hint:` We may use the code for counting divisors from Task 14.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input |      Sample Output      |
| :----------: | :---------------------: |
|      6       | 6 is not a prime number |
|      11      |  11 is a prime number   |

`Explanation:` 6 has 4 divisors: 1, 2, 3 and 6. And 11 has only 2 divisors: 1 and 11.
