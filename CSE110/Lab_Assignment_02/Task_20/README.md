Write a python program that prints a right angled triangle of height N using incrementing numbers where N will be given as input.

`Hint:` You may need to use nested loops. Try to think up to which point should the inner loop run.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  4
```

Sample Output:

```
  1
  12
  123
  1234
```

`Explanation:` For an input of 4, we have 4 rows/lines where in each line, the respective column number is printed sequentially up to the line/row number. So, in line number 1, we have 1 only. In line 2, 12 is printed. In line 3, we have 123 and so on.

Sample Input:

```
  5
```

Sample Output:

```
  1
  12
  123
  1234
  12345
```

`Explanation:` Numbers are printed sequentially up to the line number for each of the lines.
