Write a Python code for the following:

- Ask the user to enter a Number, N
- Display the summation of multiples of 7 up to that number (from 1 to N inclusive)

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|      50      |      196      |
|      75      |      385      |

`Explanation:` The summation of multiples of 7 up to 50 is 7 + 14 + 21 + 28 + 35 + 42 + 49 = 196
