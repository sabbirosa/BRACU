Write a python program that converts a binary number to a decimal integer number after taking the binary number as an input from the user.

`Note:` A binary number can be converted to its corresponding decimal number by multiplying each binary digit with a power of 2, where the power denotes the position of the binary digit

For example, to convert 1010 to decimal, we can do this

$2^3$ x $1 + 2^2$ x $0 + 2^1$ x $1 + 2^0$ x $0 = 10$

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|     1010     |      10       |
|    11101     |      29       |
