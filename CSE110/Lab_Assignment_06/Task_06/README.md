Write a function which will take 1 argument, number of days.

Your first task is to take the number of days as user input and pass the value to the function.

Your second task is to implement the function and calculate the total number of years, number
of months, and the remaining number of days as output. No need to return any value, print
inside the function.

`Note:` Assume, each year to be 365 days and month to be 30 days.

`Hint(1):` Divide and mod the main input to get the desired output.

`Hint(2):` This task’s calculation is similar to Assignment-1’s seconds to hours, minutes
conversion.

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```
  4330
```

Function Call:

```
  function_name(4330)
```

Output:

```
  11 years, 10 months and 15 days
```

Sample Input:

```
  2250
```

Function Call:

```
  function_name(2250)
```

Output:
