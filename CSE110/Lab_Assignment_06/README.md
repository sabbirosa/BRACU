### Task 5

Write a function called calculate_tax that takes 3 arguments: your age, salary, and current job designation.

Your first task is to take these arguments as user input and pass these values to the function.

Your second task is to implement the function and calculate the tax as the following conditions:

- NO TAX IF YOU ARE LESS THAN 18 YEARS OLD.
- NO TAX IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY
- No tax if you get paid less than 10,000
- 5% tax if you get paid between 10K and 20K
- 10% tax if you get paid more than 20K

Finally return this tax value. Then print the returned value in the function call.

`Hints:` Here the job designation is a string, so it can be written in both uppercase and lower cases. So,
you need to check the value ignoring the case.

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```

**[Must use tuple packing & unpacking]**

### Test Case

Function Call:

```
  area_circumference_generator(1)
```

Output:

  (3.141592653589793, 6.283185307179586)
  Area of the circle is 3.141592653589793 and circumference is 6.283185307179586
```

Function Call:

```
  area_circumference_generator(1.5)
```

Output:

```
  (7.0685834705770345, 9.42477796076938)

### Task 10

Write a function called make_square that takes a tuple in the parameter as a range of numbers (starting point and ending point (included)). The function should return a dictionary with the numbers as keys and its squares as values.

`Hints:` You need to declare a dictionary to store the result. You should use the range function to run the ‚Äúfor loop‚Äù.

### Test Case

Function Call:

```
  make_square((1,3))
```

Output:

```
  {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
```

Function Call:

### Task 11

Write a function called rem_duplicate that takes a tuple in the parameter and return a tuple removing all the duplicate values. Then print the returned tuple in the function call.

**[Cannot use remove() or removed() for this task]**

`Hint:` Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, so the tuple taken as an argument cannot be modified. But the list can be modified and lastly for returning the result use type conversion. You need to use membership operators (in, not in) for preventing adding any duplicates values.

### Test Case

Function Call:

```
  rem_duplicate((1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0))
```

Output:

```
  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0)
```

Function Call:

```
  rem_duplicate(("Hi", 1, 2, 3, 3, "Hi",'a', 'a', [1,2]))
```

Output:

```
  ('Hi', 1, 2, 3, 'a', [1, 2])

### Task 12

Write a python function that takes a list as an argument. Your task is to create a new list where each element can be present at max 2 times. Inside the function, print the number of elements removed from the given list. Finally, return the new list and print the result.

`Hint:` You may use list_name.count(element) to count the total number of times an element is in a list. list_name is your new list for this problem.

### Test Case

Function Call:

```
  function_name([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 8, 8])
```

Output:

```
  Removed: 2
  [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 8, 8]
```

Function Call:

```
  function_name([10, 10, 15, 15, 20])
```

Output:

```
  Removed: 0
  [10, 10, 15, 15, 20]

### Task 14

Write a function which will take 2 arguments. They are:

- Sentence
- Position

Your first task is to take these arguments as user input and pass these values to the function parameters.

Your second task is to implement the function and remove the characters at the index number which is divisible by the position (Avoid the index number 0 as it will always be divisible by the position, so no need to remove the index 0 character).

Finally, add the removed characters at the end of the new string. Return the value and then finally, print the new string at the function call.

**[Cannot use remove() or removed() for this task]**

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```
  "I love programming."
  3
```

Function Call:

```
  function_name("I love programming.", 3)
```

Output:

```
  I lveprgrmmngo oai.

### Task 15

You have been hired as an app developer for the company. The company plans to make an app for a grocery store where the user can order groceries and see the total amount to be paid in the cart section.

To build this feature, you have to write a function that takes 2 arguments. They are:

- order_items (must be a list)
- location (default value should be set to "Dhanmondi")

Your first task is to take a list of items from the user. Pass the list into the function parameter along with the optional location (Use default argument technique). (Also, no need to take location as input, pass this any value you want.)

Your second task is to implement the function. In the function, create a dictionary for the items shown in the table. Calculate the total price of the items passed as a list to the function.

Additionally, add a delivery fee of 30 taka if the location is Dhanmondi. Otherwise, add a delivery fee of 70 taka. Finally, return the value and print it.

|  Item   | Price (Tk) |
| :-----: | :--------: |
|  Rice   |    105     |
| Potato  |     20     |
| Chicken |    250     |
|  Beef   |    510     |
|   Oil   |     85     |

`Hint:` The keys are the items and values are the corresponding price. Iterate the items in the list
and check if the items in the list are available in the dictionary keys or not. If it is available, add
the price.

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```
  ["Rice", "Beef", "Rice"]
```

Function Call:

```
  function_name(["Rice", "Beef", "Rice"], "Mohakhali")
```

Output:

```
  790
```

Explaination:

```
  function_name(["Rice", "Beef", "Rice"], "Mohakhali")
  total = 105 + 510 + 105 = 720 (Take the price of each item and add them.)
  total = 720 + 70 = 790 (Finally, add the delivery fee based on the location.)
```

Sample Input:

```
  ["Rice", "Beef", "Rice"]
```

Function Call:

```
  function_name(["Rice", "Beef", "Rice"])
```

Output:

```
  750
```

Explaination:

```
  function_name(["Rice", "Beef", "Rice"])
  total = 105 + 510 + 105 = 720 (Take the price of each item and add them.)
  total = 720 + 30 = 750 (Since no location is passed in the parameter, it will use the default location-"Dhanmondi". For Dhanmondi, delivery fee of 30 taka)
```

### Task 16

Write a function called splitting_money that takes an ‚Äúamount‚Äù of money as an argument.

Your first task is to take the ‚Äúamount‚Äù of money as user input and pass the value to the function parameter.

Your second task is to implement the function and calculate how that money can be split into 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 taka notes.

Then print the returned value in the function call.

`Hint:` This task‚Äôs calculation is similar to Assignment-1‚Äôs seconds to hours, minutes conversion. To return the result containing multiple strings, you need to store it in a variable and return it at the end of the function.

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```
  1234
```

Function Call:

```
  splitting_money(1234)
```

Output:

```
  500 Taka: 2 note(s)
  100 Taka: 2 note(s)
  20 Taka: 1 note(s)
  10 Taka: 1 note(s)
  2 Taka: 2 note(s)
```

Sample Input:

```
  151
```

Function Call:

```
  splitting_money(151)
```

Output:

```
  100 Taka: 1 note(s)
  50 Taka: 1 note(s)
  1 Taka: 1 note(s)

### Task 19

Write a python function which will take a string as an argument.

Your first task is to take a string as user input and pass the value to the function.

Your second task is to implement a function which will check whether all the alphabets from a to j (convert all the alphabets to lowercase) have appeared at least once in the given string or not.

- If all of these alphabets (a to j) appear at least once, then the result will be 5.
- If any one of the alphabets (a to j) is not in the given string, then the result will be 6.

Return this result and print the statement, "PSG will win the Champions League this season" that many times.

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```
  "A black jackal is hunting a full grown deer"

Output:

```
  PSG will win the Champions League this season
  PSG will win the Champions League this season
  PSG will win the Champions League this season
  PSG will win the Champions League this season
  PSG will win the Champions League this season
```

Explaination:

```
  "A black jackal is hunting a full grown deer"
  Here all the alphabets from A to J are present at least once. So, the function will return 5 and
  will print the statement 5 times.
```

Sample Input:

```
  "ABBCDEFEFGHI"
```

Function Call:

### Task 21

You have been hired by the Abahani football club to write a function that will calculate the total bonus on the yearly earnings of each player for the total goals they have scored.
