Write a function called area_circumference_generator that takes a radius of a circle as a function parameter and calculates its circumference and area. Then returns these two results as a tuple and prints the results using tuple unpacking in the function call according to the given format.

**[Must use tuple packing & unpacking]**

### Test Case

Function Call:

```
  area_circumference_generator(1)
```

Output:

```
  (3.141592653589793, 6.283185307179586)
  Area of the circle is 3.141592653589793 and circumference is 6.283185307179586
```

Function Call:

```
  area_circumference_generator(1.5)
```

Output:

```
  (7.0685834705770345, 9.42477796076938)
  Area of the circle is 7.0685834705770345 and circumference is 9.42477796076938
```

Function Call:

```
  area_circumference_generator(2.5)
```

Output:

```
  (19.634954084936208, 15.707963267948966)
  Area of the circle is 19.634954084936208 and circumference is 15.707963267948966
```
