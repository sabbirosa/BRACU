Write a python function that will perform the basic calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) based on 3 arguments. They are:

- Operator ('+', '-', '/', '\*')
- First Operand (any number)
- Second Operand (any number)

Your first task is to take these arguments as user input and pass the values to the function parameters.

Your second task is to write a function and perform the calculation based on the given operator.

Then, finally return the result in the function call and print the result.

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```

  30.0
```

Sample Input:

```
  "*"
  5.5
  2.5
```

Function Call:

```
