Suppose you have a list named my_list as given below. Your task is to sort the list in ascending order and print the count of numbers that have changed their positions in the process of sorting.

```
  my_list = [4, 2, 3, 1, 6, 5]
```

The sorted list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` where 4 numbers `(4, 1, 6, 5)` have changed their positions.

Therefore our sample output here would be 4. Please check if your code is working correctly by changing the above list and using the knowledge given here to verify whether your code gives the correct output for all different lists.

Output:

```
  4
```
