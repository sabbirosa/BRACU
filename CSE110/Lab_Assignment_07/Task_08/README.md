Write a python program that takes a list from a user containing both positive and negative numbers. The program then finds two pairs of values whose summation is closest to zero.

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```
  list_one = [-10, 15, 2, 4, -4, 7, -8]
```

Sample Output:

```
  Two pairs which have the smallest sum = 4 and -4
```

Sample Input:

```
  list_one = [1, -8, 4, -7, -20, 26, 70, -85]
```

Sample Output:

```
  Two pairs which have the smallest sum = 4 and -7
```
