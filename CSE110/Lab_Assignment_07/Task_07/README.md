Write a python program that takes two lists from the user, merges the two lists, sorts the resulting list, and then finds the median of the elements in the two lists.

### Test Case

Sample Input:

```
  list_one = [1, 2, 1, 4]
  list_two = [5, 4, 1]
```

Sample Output:

```
  Sorted list = [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5]
  Median = 2
```

Sample Input:

```
  list_one = [1, 7, 9, 10]
  list_two = [2, 7, 6, 5]
```

Sample Output:

```
  Sorted list = [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 7, 9, 10]
  Median = 6.5
```
