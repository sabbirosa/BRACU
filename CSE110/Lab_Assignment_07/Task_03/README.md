Suppose you have a list named my_list as given below

```
  my_list = [10, 1, 20, 3, 6, 2, 5, 11, 15, 2, 12, 14, 17, 18, 29]
```

Now use any of the two sorting techniques you have used above to sort the list in descending order.

Output:

```
  [29, 20, 18, 17, 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1]
```
