Write a python program that reads 5 numbers from the user into a list, and then prints them in the reverse order.

`Hint:` You may create a list to store the input numbers and then use loop to print them in reverse order

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  5
  -5
  100
  1
  0
```

Sample Output:

```
  Input data: [5, -5, 100, 1, 0]
  Printing values from the list in reverse order:
  0
  1
  100
  -5
  5
```
