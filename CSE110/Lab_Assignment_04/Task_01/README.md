Write a Python program that reads 5 numbers from the user into a list. After reading each number, print all the numbers that have been entered so far in the list.

`Example:`

```
If the user enters 3, prints “Numbers in the list: [3]”
If the user enters 5 next, prints “Numbers in the list: [3, 5]”
If the user enters 34, prints “Numbers in the list: [3, 5, 34]”
If the user then enters -11, prints “Numbers in the list: [3, 5, 34, -11]”
Finally, if the user enters 0 as the last number, prints “Numbers in the list: [3, 5, 34, -11, 0]”
```
