Assume, you have been given two lists: List_one and List_two. [Your program should work for any two given lists; change the following lists and check whether your program works correctly for the code you have written]

Write a Python program that prints "True", if the given two lists have at least one common member. Otherwise, print "False".

`Note:` Please use concepts of flag and break to solve this task.

#### Test Case:

Given List:

```
  List_one : [1, 4, 3, 2, 6]
  List_two : [5, 6, 9, 8, 7]
```

Sample Output:

```
  True
```

Given List:

```
  List_one : [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]
  List_two : [8, 7, 6, 9]
```

Sample Output:

```
  False
```
