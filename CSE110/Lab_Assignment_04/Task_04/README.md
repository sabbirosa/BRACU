Write a Python program that turns every item of a list into its square. [Your program should work for any lists; make changes to the lists below and check whether your program works correctly]

#### Test Case:

| Given List            | Sample Output             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------ |
| [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] | [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49] |
| [3, 5, 1, 6]          | [9, 25, 1, 36]            |
