# Lab Assignment 4 (List) üìù

### Task 1

Write a Python program that reads 5 numbers from the user into a list. After reading each number, print all the numbers that have been entered so far in the list.

`Example:`

```
If the user enters 3, prints ‚ÄúNumbers in the list: [3]‚Äù
If the user enters 5 next, prints ‚ÄúNumbers in the list: [3, 5]‚Äù
If the user enters 34, prints ‚ÄúNumbers in the list: [3, 5, 34]‚Äù
If the user then enters -11, prints ‚ÄúNumbers in the list: [3, 5, 34, -11]‚Äù
Finally, if the user enters 0 as the last number, prints ‚ÄúNumbers in the list: [3, 5, 34, -11, 0]‚Äù
```

### Task 2

Write a Python program that takes a list as an input from the user, then creates a new list excluding the first and last two elements of the given list and prints the new list. If there are not enough elements in the list to do the task, print "Not possible".

`Note:` You may use list slicing.

```
  5
  -5
  100
  1
  0
```

Sample Output:

```
  Input data: [5, -5, 100, 1, 0]
