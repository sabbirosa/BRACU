Write a Python program that removes all Empty strings from a given list and prints the modified list. [Your program should work for any given list; make changes to the list below and check whether your program works correctly]

#### Test Case:

Given List:

```
  ["hey", "there", "", "what's", "", "up", "", "?"]
```

Sample Output:

```
  Original List: ['hey', 'there', '', "what's", '', 'up', '', '?']
  Modified List: ['hey', 'there', "what's", 'up', '?']
```
