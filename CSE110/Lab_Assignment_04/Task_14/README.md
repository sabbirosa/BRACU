Write a Python program that takes two lists as an input from the user. Then print a new list with the common elements of both the input lists.

`Hint:` You may need to create a third list to store the results. You can use membership operators (in, not in) to make sure similar elements are added.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  A, B, C, D
  C, E, F, B
```

Sample Output:

```
  ['C', 'B']
```

Sample Input:

```
  1, 3, A, H, P
  A, G, 1, P, O
```

Sample Output:

```
  ['1', 'A', 'P']
```
