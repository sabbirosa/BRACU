Assume, you have been given two lists. [Your program should work for any two given lists; make changes to the lists below and check whether your program works correctly]

```
list_one = [1, 2 , 2, 4, 5, 5, 7, 99, 200, 303, 70]
list_two = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 200, 500, -5]
```

Write a Python program that creates a new list with all the unique elements of both the given lists. **You need to make sure that there are no duplicates in the resulting list.** Finally, print the updated list.

`Hint:` You may create a third list to store the results. You can use membership operators (in, not in) to make sure no duplicates are added.

Sample Output:

```
[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 99, 200, 303, 70, 3, 500, -5]
```
