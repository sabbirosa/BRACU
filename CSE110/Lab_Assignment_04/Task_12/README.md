Write a Python program that reads 7 numbers into a list and prints the second largest number and its location or index position on the list. **[You are not allowed to use the max(), sort(), sorted() function here]**

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  7, 13, 2, 10, 6, -11, 0
```

Sample Output:

```
  My list: [7, 13, 2, 10, 6, -11, 0]
  Second largest number in the list is 10 which was found at index 3.
```
