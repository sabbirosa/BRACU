Write a Python program that reads a string containing 7 numbers separated by commas, then makes a list of those numbers and prints the largest number and its location or index position in the list. **[You are not allowed to use the max(), sort(), sorted() function here]**

[Your program should work for any given list; make changes to the list below and check whether your program works correctly]

`Hint:` You may assume the first input to be the largest value initially and the largest valueâ€™s location to be 0.

`Note:` You may need to be careful while printing the output. Depending on your code, you might need data conversion.

#### Test Case:

Sample Input:

```
  "7, 13, 2, 10, 6, -11, 0"
```

Sample Output:

```
  My list: [7, 13, 2, 10, 6, -11, 0]
  Largest number in the list is 13 which was found at index 1.
```
