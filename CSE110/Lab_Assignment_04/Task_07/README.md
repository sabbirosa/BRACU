Suppose you have been given two lists. Write a Python program that replaces the last element of the first list with the second list. [Your program should work for any two given lists; make changes to the lists below and check whether your program works correctly]

#### Test Case:

| Given List                                                  | Sample Output               |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| List_one : [1, 4, 7, 5] <br> List_two : [6, 1, 3, 9]        | [1, 4, 7, 6, 1, 3, 9]       |
| List_one : [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10] <br> List_two : [2, 4, 6, 8] | [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8] |
