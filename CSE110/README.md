# CSE 110: Programming Language I

In this section, you will solve a series of exercises that will help you develop the fundamentals of programming language. Anyone who has an understanding of the basics of programming can try their hand at solving these challenges, which will further their knowledge of programming. Along with regular practice, making it a habit to find solutions to challenges like these will increase a person's programming skills significantly.

`Instruction:` Simply click on the name of any part below to begin and scrol down after entering to the respective folder. In addition, the answers to all of your problems are provided along with your assignments. However, you need to develop the skill of solving problems without looking at the solutions themselves. That's the only way to ensure accuracy in programming.

`NB:` The solutions shown here are implemented in Python; however, these problems can be solved by anyone using any programming language.
