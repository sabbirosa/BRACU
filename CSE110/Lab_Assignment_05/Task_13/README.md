Suppose you have been given the following list of tuples.

```
  list_1 = [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("a", 3), ("b", 1), ("a", 2), ("c", 1)]
```

Write a Python program that converts this list of tuples into a dictionary and then prints the dictionary.

**[You are not allowed to use set]**

`Hint:` Think of membership operators (in and not in).

Output:

```
  {'a': [1, 3, 2], 'b': [2, 1], 'c': [1]}
```
