Write a python program that takes an input from the user and finds the number of times that the input is present in a given tuple.

```
  Given tuple: (10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)
```

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input | Sample Output                  |
| :----------: | :----------------------------- |
|      8       | 8 appears 4 times in the tuple |
|      1       | 1 appears 0 times in the tuple |
