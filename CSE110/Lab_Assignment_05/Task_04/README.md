Assume, you have been given a tuple with details about books that won the Good Reads Choice Awards.

```
  book_info = ( ("Best Mystery & Thriller","The Silent Patient",68821), ("Best Horror","The Institute",75717), ("Best History & Biography","The five",31783 ), ("Best Fiction","The Testaments",98291) )
```

Write a Python program that prints the award category, the book name, and its total votes earned as shown below.

**[Must use Tuple unpacking for printing and need to handle the quotation marks as a part of the output]**

Output:

```
  The Silent Patient won the 'Best Mystery & Thriller' category with 68821 votes
  The Institute won the 'Best Horror' category with 75717 votes
  The five won the 'Best History & Biography' category with 31783 votes
  The Testaments won the 'Best Fiction' category with 98291 votes
```
