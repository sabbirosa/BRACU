Assume, you have been given a tuple. Write a Python program that creates a new tuple excluding the first and last two elements of the given tuple and prints the new tuple.

`Hint:` You may use tuple slicing.

#### Test Case:

| Sample Input                 | Sample Output |
| :--------------------------- | :------------ |
| (10, 20, 24, 25, 26, 35, 70) | (24, 25, 26)  |
| (-10, 20, 30, 40)            | ()            |
| (-10, 20, 25, 30, 40)        | (25,)         |
